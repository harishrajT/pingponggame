# Ping Pong Game

This is a simple recreation of the classic Pong game built using Python's Turtle graphics library. The game features two paddles and a ball, allowing two players to control the paddles and score points when the ball passes their opponent's paddle.

## Features

- **Two Player Controls:** 
  - The right paddle is controlled using the Up and Down arrow keys.
  - The left paddle is controlled using the "W" and "S" keys.
  
- **Ball Movement:**
  - The ball bounces off the paddles and the top and bottom walls.
  - If the ball passes a paddle, the opposing player scores a point.

- **Scoreboard:** 
  - Tracks and displays the scores of both players in real-time.
  - The game resets the ball position after a point is scored, and the ball speeds up after each paddle hit.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Turtle graphics library (pre-installed with Python)

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository** or download the code files.
2. Run the `pingponggame.py` script using Python:
   ```bash
